# Project Name: Local/Remote AI Client

## Overview
**Currently working on:** Implementing a flexible AI client that can operate either locally or via API calls. The goal is to create a fully trainable, extendable, and documentable AI client for various applications.

This project provides a framework that supports local model training, model customization for different use cases, and documentation generation. Additionally, it includes options for both Java and Python integration to leverage diverse AI models and datasets from sources like Hugging Face. The client aims to be accessible either as a standalone local application or a web-based interface with a Java backend.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**  
   - Ensure Python and Java are installed on your system.
   - Set up a virtual environment for Python and install required packages.
  
2. **Configure Hugging Face API**  
   - Obtain a Hugging Face API token and set it as an environment variable (`HF_TOKEN`) for secure access.
   - Use the provided script to log in and download models as needed.

3. **Set Up Local Model Directory**  
   - Define a directory where models can be downloaded, trained, and stored.

4. **Run the Application**  
   - Start the client in either web or local mode based on configuration preferences.
   - Customize model training and functionality through the sidebar options in the UI.

## Future Goals

- **Enhanced Model Customization**: Additional support for specialized models for NLP, vision, and other domains.
- **Multi-Platform Compatibility**: Extending the framework to support additional deployment options across different platforms.
- **User-Friendly Templates**: More customization options for documentation templates.
